# Consortia

Welcome to Our Consortia of Resources!

Tradional business models focus on 1-to-1 or at times, 1-to-many, if fortunate. With a Consortium, individuals and companies are able to join a network of secure, reliable and fast partnerships. Say goodbye to long negotiations or slow transactions. By joining our Consortia, you instantly gain access to the resources and services provided by the node of companies that are already using the group!

There are various flavors of JS here: redux, react, react component classes, hooks, etc. I wanted to demonstrate various patterns.

## Installation

Clone this repository at: https://github.com/danpatnate/consortia.git

## Running

```bash
npm i && PORT=3001 node bin/www
cd client/ npm i
yarn start
```

## Next Steps
- Clean up code - move CSS to SASS and remove quick inline styles
- Persist data for returning users (database or localStorage)
- Enable users permissions (login or basic user types)
- Allow users to join, not just companies

## Thank you!
